							<p>
								In the Spring of 2008, two families met in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian. Their children, Colin and Andrew, were born with congenital heart defects ("CHDs"), and would spend the first weeks of their lives recovering from heart surgeries performed shortly after birth.  Andrew survived a transposition of the great arteries, thanks to an arterial switch procedure that did not exist until thirty years ago. Colin, born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, died from surgical complications after only 47 days, despite the best efforts of the dedicated staff at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. The families founded Colin's Kids in memory of Colin, whose brief time nevertheless brought incredible joy to his family and friends, and in honor of Andrew, Colin's first and best buddy.
							</p>
								<p>
									Our volunteer Board of Directors has two goals: to fund research to develop and improve life-saving and life-improving treatment for children born with CHDs, and to provide financial aid to parents of children born with CHDs, struggling to obtain the best available care for their children. Colin's Kids will make a difference addressing a startling void. Despite being the most common congenital birth defect, CHDs receive a small fraction of the funding of many other childhood illnesses. Additional funding for research can and will lead to new and improved procedures to treat and cure heart defects, so that children and their families can lead normal and full lives.
