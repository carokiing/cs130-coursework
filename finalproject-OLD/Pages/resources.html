            Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of all congenital birth defects. It is estimated that 0.8-1% of the population is affected by some form of congenital heart disease. CHD comes in many different forms and refers to congenital malformations of the heart during development. It presents as a spectrum and can affect the chambers of the heart, the heart valves, or the major blood vessels coming to and leaving from the heart. CHD leads to abnormal flow of blood through the heart and the body manifesting as either decreased heart function, congestive heart failure (CHF) or cyanosis.

            The severity of the congenital heart defect dictates the appropriate treatment. Some of the less severe conditions can be followed closely by pediatric cardiologists and may even resolve as the child grows. In contrast, the more severe forms are lifelong illnesses that require many hospitalizations, surgeries, cardiac interventions and even heart transplantation to help palliate. In recent years, advances in diagnosis and treatment have greatly improved the survival and quality of life for even the most severe patients. However, there still remains a tremendous amount of work to be done to understand and treat CHD.
